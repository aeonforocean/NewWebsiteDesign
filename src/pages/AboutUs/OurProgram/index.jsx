            <h2>What is "Krill to Whale"?</h2>
            <p><b>Krill2Whale</b> is a shared learning program focused on educating kids about marine life and oceans to achieve the following objectives:
				<ul>
					<li>Learn about marine eco-system, its importance and one's role in protecting it</li>
					<li>Participate and promote activities to save our oceans from inland</li>
					<li>Increase awareness about oceans by sharing knowledge in schools and communities</li>
				</ul>
                
                    {"It is founded on recognizing the value in allowing young children to pass their knowledge and enthusiasm about marine creatures and our role in protecting them and their habitat along to their peers and members of their community.\n\nDoes your school or local community have what it takes to help protect the ocean for the future? Promote ocean conservation at your school or in your local community by becoming a Krill. Krill2Whale program will be a 30 to 45 minutes interactive presentation by me, a Krill (Aeon) in your school or library about oceans, marine creatures and its conservation and how it is key to human life."}
